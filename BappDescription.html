<p>This extension monitors a provided JWT token for expiration and
  automatically replaces any existing JWT tokens in outgoing requests
  with the monitored one. It also includes an autopilot mode that
  intelligently pauses task execution when the JWT token is about to
  expire and resumes automatically when a new token with sufficient
  validity is provided.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Monitors JWT token expiration with real-time countdown
    display</li>
  <li>Automatically replaces existing JWT tokens in Authorization
    headers and cookies</li>
  <li>Autopilot mode that pauses task execution when token expires
    within one minute</li>
  <li>Automatic task resumption when new JWT token with at least three
    minutes validity is supplied</li>
  <li>Visual expiration warnings with color-coded status
    indicators</li>
  <li>Displays decoded JWT header, payload, and signature in formatted
    JSON</li>
  <li>Comprehensive logging of token replacements and task control
    actions</li>
</ul>

  <li>Click the Apply button to start monitoring the token</li>
  <li>The extension will display the token's expiration countdown and
    decoded components</li>
  <li>All outgoing requests will automatically have their JWT tokens
    replaced with your monitored token</li>
  <li>To enable autopilot mode, click the Autopilot toggle button</li>
  <li>When autopilot is enabled, task execution will pause when the
    token has less than one minute remaining and resume automatically when
    a new token with at least three minutes validity is provided</li>
  <li>Monitor the log area for real-time updates on token replacements
    and task control actions</li>
</ol>

  (<code class="InlineCode">Bearer</code> format) and cookies,
  automatically detecting and replacing tokens that begin with <code class="InlineCode">eyJ</code>.</p>
